Feel free to create a folder here for any work you want to upload.

From here on in we'll be working on the game in the FINAL folder.
Feel free to edit it as needed, since we'll all be working on it.
You can also copy and paste any code you have into it as well.

Goals we've decided on:
- Adding enemies [Owen]
- "Deserted island" map and story (will wait to see if Chris has anything, otherwise we weill do this)
- Sound effects/Music
- Game timer [Joe]
- Visual map
- Using items
